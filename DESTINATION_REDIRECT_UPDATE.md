# Destination Card Redirect Feature

## Overview
Transformed all 15 popular destination cards in the "Popular Destinations" section from hover-based modal interactions to direct page navigation. When users click on any destination card, they are now redirected to the destinations.html page with comprehensive information about that specific destination.

## Changes Made

### 1. **index.html** - Destination Cards
- **Converted all 15 destination cards from `<div>` to `<a>` elements**
  - Each card now links to `destinations.html?destination={name}`
  - Cards: Paris, Tokyo, Bali, Rome, Iceland, Santorini, Dubai, Maldives, Switzerland, Thailand, Morocco, New Zealand, Peru, Norway, Australia
  
- **Removed hover-info-panel elements**
  - Eliminated all `.hover-info-panel` divs and their content
  - Removed `onclick` event handlers from cards
  - Simplified card structure for better performance

- **Link structure:**
  ```html
  <a href="destinations.html?destination=paris" class="quick-destination-card" data-destination="paris">
      <!-- Card content -->
  </a>
  ```

### 2. **styles.css** - Card Link Styling
- **Updated `.quick-destination-card` class:**
  ```css
  .quick-destination-card {
      /* ...existing styles... */
      display: block;
      text-decoration: none;
      color: inherit;
  }
  ```
  - Added `display: block` for proper link behavior
  - Added `text-decoration: none` to remove underline
  - Added `color: inherit` to maintain original text colors

### 3. **destinations.js** - Enhanced Functionality

#### A. URL Parameter Handling
```javascript
// Check if there's a destination parameter in URL
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const destinationParam = urlParams.get('destination');

if (destinationParam) {
    scrollToDestination(destinationParam);
}
```
